                        <p>
                            Nikola Tesla wasn’t just a man — he was a mind decades, maybe even centuries, ahead of his time.
                            Born in 1856, he envisioned a world powered by clean, limitless energy, communicated wirelessly across oceans, and controlled through the very fabric of electromagnetic fields.
                            But today, Tesla is more famous as a car brand than as the mastermind who once electrified the world… and then vanished from its history books.<br><br>
                            <b>Why?</b>
                        </p><br>
        
                        <hr color="grey"><br>
        
                        <h1 class="title1">🔒 Vanishing Blueprints & Seized Secrets</h1><br>
                        <p>
                            When Tesla died alone in a New York hotel in 1943, the U.S. government moved fast.
                            Within hours, the FBI raided his room and confiscated every document, blueprint, and scrap of invention they could find.<br><br>
                            They labeled his ideas “potentially dangerous to national security.”<br><br>
                            Some of those documents were never seen again. Others? Redacted. Censored. Locked away.<br><br>
                            Even now, the question remains:<br>
                            🔍 <b>What did Tesla create that was so powerful, it had to be hidden from the world?</b>
                        </p><br>
        
                        <hr color="grey"><br>
        
                        <h1 class="title1">⚡ The Inventions They Don’t Want You to Know About</h1><br>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>1. The Wireless Energy Tower (Wardenclyffe Tower):</b><br>
                                A 187-foot tall structure built to beam electricity through the air, no wires needed.
                                Tesla claimed it could power the entire Earth for free.<br>
                                But as soon as investors (like J.P. Morgan) realized they couldn’t meter or profit from the energy… funding vanished.
                                The tower was demolished.<br>
                                🔌 Free energy? Or free threat to the energy elite?
                            </li><br>
                            <li><b>2. The Death Ray (Teleforce):</b><br>
                                A particle beam weapon Tesla said could wipe out armies from miles away.
                                He offered it to world governments as a “peacekeeping” tool… but no one knows what happened to the working model.<br>
                                👁 Myth? Or prototype hidden in a vault?
                            </li><br>
                            <li><b>3. Earthquake Machine:</b><br>
                                Tesla built a small mechanical oscillator he claimed could match the natural frequency of the Earth.
                                One test allegedly shook his entire neighborhood — and he smashed the device before it went too far.<br>
                                🌍 Did he accidentally tap into a technology that could control seismic activity?
                            </li>
                        </ul><br>

                        <h1 class="title1">🤫 Suppression or Safety?</h1><br>
                        <p>
                            It’s easy to write Tesla off as eccentric. But more and more modern discoveries are beginning to validate his ideas.
                            From wireless charging to vibration-based energy to ion propulsion, Tesla may have simply lived in a time that couldn’t grasp his genius.<br><br>
                            So ask yourself:<br><br>
                            🧠 <b>Were Tesla’s inventions suppressed to protect the public… or to protect power and profit?</b>
                        </p><br>
        
                        <hr color="grey"><br>
        
                        <h1 class="title1">🧲 Final Thought</h1><br>
                        <p>
                            Maybe the scariest thing about Nikola Tesla’s inventions wasn’t what they could do — but what they could change.<br><br>
                            💡 What if we already had the answers to climate change, energy crises, and even space travel — but they were buried with a man the world chose to forget?<br><br>
                            The future Tesla imagined may still exist…<br>
